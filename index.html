            <h3>Campus Course Route Planner</h3>
            <p>A smart campus navigation tool that allows students to enter their course CRNs 
                and visualize their daily schedule on an interactive campus map. The system 
                displays building locations, calculates the optimal walking route between classes, 
                and provides key details such as number of courses, buildings visited, and total 
                distance traveled for the selected day. This helps students plan their time 
                efficiently and minimize travel across campus.</p>
